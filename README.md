# Docker + Django + VueJs + Mysql

This project was thought as a template for use Django as a Back-end and VueJs as a Frontend with MySQL as a database,
but you are free to change it.

This is a basic project that you can use for practice.

For testing I am using SQLite3, you can change it in backend.app.config.settings.DATABASES.

`./fly up`: start project.
